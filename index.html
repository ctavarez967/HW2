	<h3>About Me Page</h3> 
	<p>
My name is Cristian Tavarez and I am a senior majoring in BAIS at the University of Iowa. I was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to the United States about 8 years ago. I moved to Iowa City from a suburb of Chicago called Park Ridge. In High School I loved playing football, I was an Offensive Guard for the Maine South Hawks for three years. During my football years our team won three consecutive state champions (2008-2011) in the biggest school division in the state of Illinois. In 2009 our team was ranked #5 in the nation.

I started my studies at Iowa in 2011. When I first came to the university I had hopes of going into law school, but I eventually realized that law school was not a smart move and decided to enroll in the Tippie College of Business. I was unsure what major I was going to do but I knew I always had an interest in the field of technology.  I later found out about the BAIS major that is offered through Tippie and have been enjoying what Iâ€™m doing ever since.
